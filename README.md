Cube 3D Rendering Project
==========================

Overview
--------

This project is a simple 3D cube rendering application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project consists of two files: `index.html` and `main.js`.

Getting Started
---------------

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The cube should render in the browser window.

Files
-----

### `index.html`

This file contains the HTML structure of the application, including a `<canvas>` element where the cube is rendered. It also links to the `main.js` file, which contains the JavaScript code that renders the cube.

### `main.js`

This file contains the JavaScript code that renders the 3D cube using the WebGL API. It sets up the canvas, creates the cube geometry, and renders the cube using WebGL.

Features
--------

* Renders a 3D cube using WebGL
* Uses HTML and CSS for the application structure and styling
* JavaScript code is organized in a single file (`main.js`)
